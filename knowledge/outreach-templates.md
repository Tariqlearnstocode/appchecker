## Cold Call Scripts

### Script 1: Gatekeeper (Getting Past Front Desk)

**Goal:** Get transferred or get decision-maker's direct line.

---

**You:** Hi, this is Tariq calling for {{first_name}}. Is [he/she] available?

**Gatekeeper:** What's this regarding?

**You:** I work with property management companies on tenant screening. {{first_name}} and I haven't connected yet—is [he/she] in the office today?

**If they push back:**

**You:** I understand. Would you mind passing along my number? Or if there's a better time to reach [him/her], I'm happy to call back.

**If they ask for more details:**

**You:** Sure—we help property managers verify applicant income without chasing pay stubs. Takes about 5 minutes instead of days. I just wanted to see if that's something {{company}} deals with.

---

### Script 2: Decision-Maker Opener (First 30 Seconds)

**Goal:** Earn 60 more seconds of their time.

---

**You:** {{first_name}}, this is Tariq with Income Checker. Do you have a quick minute?

**[If yes]**

**You:** Thanks. I'll be brief. I work with property managers who are tired of chasing pay stubs and waiting days for income docs from applicants.

We built a tool where the applicant connects their bank, and you get an income report in minutes. No documents, no employer calls.

Is that a problem you're dealing with at {{company}}?

**[If no/busy]**

**You:** No problem. When's a better time for a 5-minute call? I can send a calendar invite.

---

### Script 3: Discovery Questions

**Goal:** Understand their pain, qualify the opportunity.

---

**Current Process:**
- How do you currently verify income for applicants?
- Walk me through what happens after an applicant applies.
- How long does that usually take from application to approval?

**Pain Points:**
- What's the hardest part about getting income documentation?
- How often do applicants ghost you during the verification process?
- Have you ever had issues with fake or doctored pay stubs?

**Volume & Scale:**
- How many units are you managing right now?
- Roughly how many applications do you process per month?
- Who on your team handles the screening process?

**Decision Making:**
- If you found something that worked, what would the process look like to try it?
- Is there anyone else who'd need to weigh in on a new screening tool?

---

### Script 4: Objection Handling

---

**"We already have a screening solution."**

> That makes sense. Most of our customers did too. The difference is we focus only on income—no credit pulls, no employer verification. Just bank-connected income data. It's faster and gives you data that's harder to fake. Would it be worth seeing how it compares?

---

**"We just use pay stubs."**

> I hear that a lot. The challenge is pay stubs are easy to fake now—you can buy realistic ones online for $30. Our reports pull directly from the applicant's bank transactions, so you're seeing actual deposits, not a document they created.

---

**"We don't have budget for this."**

> I get it. Quick question—how much time does your team spend chasing income docs per application? If it's more than an hour, you're probably spending more in labor than our $14.99 per verification. Worth a quick look?

---

**"We're too busy right now."**

> Totally understand. When would be a better time to revisit this? I can follow up in [2 weeks / next month] if that's easier.

---

**"Send me some information."**

> Happy to. What specifically would be most helpful—pricing, how it works, or case studies from other PMs? I'll send that over today. What's the best email?

---

**"I need to talk to my partner/boss."**

> Of course. Would it help if I put together a quick one-pager you can share with them? Or if it's easier, I can jump on a call with both of you.

---

### Script 5: Close / Next Steps

**Goal:** Get a commitment—demo, trial, or clear follow-up.

---

**If interested:**

**You:** Sounds like this could help. Here's what I'd suggest: let's do a quick 15-minute demo where I show you exactly how it works. You can see a sample report and decide if it's worth testing on your next application.

Does [day] at [time] work, or is [alternative] better?

---

**If needs to think:**

**You:** No problem. Let's do this—I'll send you a quick summary email with pricing and a sample report. Then I'll follow up [day] to see if you have questions. Fair?

---

**If not a fit:**

**You:** Appreciate you being straight with me. If anything changes or you run into screening headaches down the road, feel free to reach out. I'll send my info in case.

---

### Script 6: Voicemail (Under 30 Seconds)

**Goal:** Get a callback or prime them for your follow-up email.

---

**You:** Hi {{first_name}}, this is Tariq with Income Checker. I work with property managers who are tired of chasing pay stubs from applicants.

We built a tool that gets you income reports in minutes—applicant connects their bank, you get the data. No documents to chase.

I'll send you a quick email with details. My number is [phone number]. Thanks.

## A/B Test Ideas

**Call Openers:**
- Permission-based ("Do you have a quick minute?") vs. direct (straight to value prop)
- Industry reference ("I work with property managers...") vs. specific ("I saw {{company}} manages units in {{city}}...")

**Voicemail:**
- With callback number vs. "check your email"
- Short (20 sec) vs. slightly longer (30 sec)
