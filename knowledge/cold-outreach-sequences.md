## Sequence 1: Initial Cold Outreach

```
Trigger: New prospect added to Instantly
Goal: Book a demo call
Length: 4 emails over 14 days
Exit: They reply (positive or negative)
```

### Email 1: Pattern Interrupt
**Send:** Day 0
**Subject:** quick question about {{company}}
**Preview:** How much time do you spend chasing pay stubs?

```
Hi {{first_name}},

Weird question — how much time do you spend chasing pay stubs from applicants?

We built a tool that lets applicants connect their bank directly. You get a verified income report in 5 minutes. $14.99 per verification.

Worth a quick look?

```

**CTA:** Reply
**Why it works:** Opens with curiosity, addresses specific pain, price anchors value

---

### Email 2: Problem Agitation
**Send:** Day 3
**Subject:** re: quick question about {{company}}
**Preview:** Fake pay stubs cost $30 on Instagram

```
{{first_name}},

Did you know you can buy fake pay stubs on Instagram for $30?

That's what you're competing with when you ask for documents.

Bank-connected income verification solves this. Applicant links their account, you see real deposits. No PDFs to verify. No documents to fake.

15-minute demo if you're curious: [CALENDAR LINK]

Tariq
```

**CTA:** Book demo
**Why it works:** Introduces fear/risk they may not have considered

---

### Email 3: Social Proof
**Send:** Day 7
**Subject:** what other PMs are doing
**Preview:** Takes applicants 5 minutes, costs you $14.99

```
{{first_name}},

Quick update on what we're seeing with property managers:

→ Average time from request to report: 5 minutes
→ Applicants prefer it (no hunting for documents)
→ PMs save 30+ min per application

If you're still chasing pay stubs manually, might be worth 15 min to see how it works.

```

**CTA:** Book demo
**Why it works:** Shows others are doing it, quantifies benefit

---

### Email 4: Breakup
**Send:** Day 14
**Subject:** should I close your file?
**Preview:** No hard feelings either way

```
{{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times — totally understand if this isn't a priority right now.

Three quick reasons PMs switch to bank-verified income:

1. No more fake pay stubs
2. 5-minute turnaround vs. days of back-and-forth
3. $14.99 vs. $30-50 for traditional screening

If tenant screening isn't a pain point for you, no worries. But if it is, I'm happy to show you how it works.

Either way, I'll stop filling your inbox.

Tariq
```

**CTA:** Reply or book demo
**Why it works:** Creates urgency through potential loss, summarizes value

---

## Sequence 2: Warm Lead Follow-Up

```
Trigger: Replied positively but went quiet (no response in 5+ days)
Goal: Re-engage and book demo
Length: 3 emails over 10 days
Exit: They reply or book
```

### Email 1: Gentle Bump
**Send:** Day 5 after last contact
**Subject:** re: {{previous_subject}}
**Preview:** Wanted to make sure this didn't get buried

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Just bumping this up — wanted to make sure it didn't get buried.

Still interested in seeing how the bank-verified income reports work?

Happy to jump on a quick call whenever works for you: [CALENDAR LINK]

### Email 2: Add Value
**Send:** Day 8 after last contact
**Subject:** thought you'd find this useful
**Preview:** Quick breakdown of how it works

```
{{first_name}},

Since we last talked, I put together a quick breakdown of how bank-verified income works vs. traditional pay stub collection:

**Traditional:**
- Ask for docs → Wait → Chase → Review → Maybe fake

**Bank-verified:**
- Send link → Applicant connects bank → Done (5 min)

If you want to see it in action, grab 15 min here: [CALENDAR LINK]

Tariq
```

---

### Email 3: Direct Ask
**Send:** Day 12 after last contact
**Subject:** quick yes or no?
**Preview:** Just want to know where we stand

```
{{first_name}},

I don't want to keep bugging you — just want to know where we stand.

Quick yes or no: Is income verification something you're still looking to improve?

If yes, let's find 15 min: [CALENDAR LINK]
If no, totally fine — just let me know and I'll stop reaching out.

```

## Sequence 3: Referral Request

```
Trigger: Customer has been active for 30+ days, completed 5+ verifications
Goal: Get 1-2 warm introductions
Length: 2 emails over 7 days
Exit: They reply
```

### Email 1: Ask for Intros
**Send:** Day 30 after signup (or after 5th verification)
**Subject:** quick favor?
**Preview:** Know anyone else who'd find this useful?

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Hope the income reports have been working well for you.

Quick favor — do you know 1-2 other property managers or landlords who might find this useful?

We're still small and growing mostly through word of mouth. A quick intro would mean a lot.

If anyone comes to mind, just reply with their name/email and I'll reach out (won't be pushy, promise).

Thanks,
Tariq
```

### Email 2: Make It Easy
**Send:** Day 7 after first ask (if no response)
**Subject:** re: quick favor?
**Preview:** Made it easy for you

```
{{first_name}},

Following up on my ask — totally understand if you're busy.

To make it easier, here's a quick blurb you can forward:

---

*"Hey — I've been using Income Checker for tenant income verification. Applicants connect their bank, I get a report in 5 minutes. Way easier than chasing pay stubs. Thought you might want to check it out: [LINK]"*

---

No pressure either way. Appreciate you!

Tariq
```

## Sequence 4: "Not Now" Nurture

```
Trigger: Prospect said "not right now" or "check back later"
Goal: Stay top of mind until timing is right
Length: 3 emails over 60 days
Exit: They re-engage or ask to stop
```

### Email 1: Respect + Stay Connected
**Send:** Day 30 after "not now"
**Subject:** checking in (no pitch)
**Preview:** Just wanted to stay on your radar

```
Hey {{first_name}},

You mentioned timing wasn't right when we last talked — totally respect that.

Just wanted to stay on your radar. If income verification becomes a priority, I'm here.

No pitch, just checking in.

Tariq
```

---

### Email 2: Share Something Useful
**Send:** Day 45 after "not now"
**Subject:** thought of you
**Preview:** Quick tip on screening

```
{{first_name}},

Random thought — one thing we've seen PMs do to speed up screening:

Ask for bank connection *before* the application fee. Serious applicants don't mind. Tire-kickers drop off.

Saves time chasing people who were never going to qualify.

Anyway, hope things are going well. Let me know if you ever want to revisit income verification.

Tariq
```

---

### Email 3: Soft Re-Engage
**Send:** Day 60 after "not now"
**Subject:** still on your radar?
**Preview:** Happy to reconnect if timing is better

```
{{first_name}},

It's been a couple months — wanted to see if income verification is back on your radar.

If so, happy to do a quick 15-min demo: [CALENDAR LINK]

If not, no worries. I'll check back in a few months unless you tell me to stop.

Tariq
```

## Sequence 5: Post-Demo No Decision

```
Trigger: Had demo call but didn't sign up
Goal: Close the deal
Length: 3 emails over 10 days
Exit: They sign up or decline
```

### Email 1: Recap + Easy Next Step
**Send:** Day 1 after demo
**Subject:** next steps for {{company}}
**Preview:** Recap from our call + how to get started

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Great chatting today. Quick recap:

**What we covered:**
- How applicants connect their bank (takes ~5 min)
- What the income report shows (deposits, patterns, balances)
- Pricing: $14.99/verification or $59/mo for 10

**To get started:**
Just sign up here: [SIGNUP LINK]
First verification takes about 2 minutes to set up.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Tariq
```

### Email 2: Handle Objection
**Send:** Day 4 after demo
**Subject:** one thing I forgot to mention
**Preview:** In case this was a concern

```
{{first_name}},

One thing I should've mentioned on our call:

If you're worried about applicants not wanting to connect their bank — we've found the opposite is true. Most prefer it over hunting for pay stubs.

The connection is read-only (we can't move money), and they can disconnect anytime after you get the report.

Happy to answer any other questions: [CALENDAR LINK]

Or just sign up and try it: [SIGNUP LINK]

### Email 3: Create Urgency
**Send:** Day 10 after demo
**Subject:** before I move on
**Preview:** Want to make sure you're all set

```
{{first_name}},

Wanted to follow up one more time before I move on to other folks.

If Income Checker makes sense for {{company}}, now's a good time to get started. Happy to help you through setup.

If it's not the right fit, no hard feelings — just let me know so I can update my notes.

Either way, appreciated your time on the demo.

Tariq
