### About Section Template

Use this structure for all founders (customize the personal details):

```
I help [target audience] solve [specific problem].

Here's the thing about tenant screening:
- Fake pay stubs are everywhere
- Employer verification takes days (if they respond)
- Credit reports don't show actual income
- Landlords are left guessing

That's why we built Income Checker.

Applicants connect their bank account (securely via Plaid), and landlords get a verified income report in minutes. No credit pull. No employer calls. No guessing.

What I'm working on:
[Bullet 1 - current focus]
[Bullet 2 - company milestone]
[Bullet 3 - personal angle]

Previously: [brief background]

Let's connect if you're:
- A landlord tired of income verification headaches
- A PM looking for faster screening tools
- Building in PropTech and want to swap notes

DM me "VERIFY" and I'll show you how it works.
```

## 2. Content Pillars

Rotate through these five themes to maintain variety and hit different audience motivations.

### Pillar 1: Pain Point Content (Screening Frustrations)

**Purpose:** Show you understand their problems deeply

**Topics:**
- The fake pay stub epidemic
- When employer verification fails
- Tenants who "make $80K" but can't pay rent
- The cost of a bad tenant (time, money, stress)
- Why credit scores don't tell the income story
- Screening horror stories (anonymized)

**Post frequency:** 2-3x per week across all founders

**Example hooks:**
- "Last week I talked to a landlord who lost $15,000 to a tenant with perfect credit..."
- "Fake pay stubs are getting scary good. Here's one that fooled 3 landlords..."
- "The most expensive mistake landlords make isn't a bad tenant. It's trusting the wrong documents."

---

### Pillar 2: Industry Insights (Rental Market Trends)

**Purpose:** Position founders as informed industry voices

**Topics:**
- Rental market stats and trends
- Regulatory changes affecting landlords
- Economic factors impacting tenants
- Technology adoption in property management
- Industry reports and data analysis

**Post frequency:** 1-2x per week (primarily Clarence)

**Example hooks:**
- "Eviction rates are up 34% in [state]. Here's what landlords need to know..."
- "The average cost of tenant turnover is now $3,500. But it's not the vacancy that hurts most..."
- "3 rental market trends that will define 2026 (and how smart landlords are preparing)"

---

### Pillar 3: Behind-the-Scenes (Building the Product)

**Purpose:** Build connection through transparency; attract early adopters

**Topics:**
- Feature launches and updates
- Technical decisions explained simply
- Founder journey and lessons learned
- Team dynamics and company culture
- Challenges and how you're solving them
- User feedback and how it shapes the product

**Post frequency:** 2x per week (rotate all founders)

**Example hooks:**
- "We just shipped our biggest feature yet. Here's why it took 3 months..."
- "A landlord's feedback last week made us rebuild our entire report layout..."
- "The hardest part of building Income Checker isn't the code. It's..."
- "We made a mistake that cost us 2 weeks. Here's what we learned."

---

### Pillar 4: Social Proof (Customer Success)

**Purpose:** Build credibility and trust through results

**Topics:**
- Customer testimonials and quotes
- Case studies (with permission)
- Usage milestones and metrics
- Before/after stories
- Reviews and feedback highlights

**Post frequency:** 1-2x per week (post-launch, start with beta user feedback)

**Example hooks:**
- "Sarah manages 45 units. She used to spend 3 hours per applicant on income verification..."
- "'I wish I had this 5 years ago.' Here's why this landlord said that..."
- "We just crossed 1,000 verifications. Here's what we've learned from every single one."

**Pre-launch alternative:** Share waitlist numbers, beta user quotes, or problem validation conversations.

---

### Pillar 5: Educational Content (Tips for Landlords)

**Purpose:** Provide value that earns attention and trust

**Topics:**
- How to spot fake documents
- Screening best practices
- Red flags in applications
- Income-to-rent ratios explained
- Legal considerations in screening
- Efficiency tips for busy landlords

**Post frequency:** 2x per week (great for Tyrese and Lamar)

**Example hooks:**
- "5 red flags on a pay stub that most landlords miss..."
- "The 3x income rule is outdated. Here's what smart landlords use instead..."
- "I screened 500+ tenants. Here are the 3 questions I always ask..."
- "Stop asking for 2 months of pay stubs. Here's why..."

---

## 3. Post Formats That Work

### Text-Only Posts (80% of your content)

**Best for:** Stories, insights, opinions, lessons learned

**Structure for high-performing text posts:**

```
[Hook - 1-2 lines that stop the scroll]

[Space]

[Story or context - 3-5 short paragraphs]

[Space]

[Insight or lesson]

[Space]

[CTA or question]
```

**Formatting rules:**
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Use line breaks liberally
- Front-load the value (LinkedIn truncates at ~210 characters)
- End with engagement driver (question, agree/disagree, tag someone)

**Example structure:**

```
A landlord showed me something that made my jaw drop.

[Space]

A tenant's pay stub.
$6,200/month income.
Perfect formatting.
Company logo. Check stubs. Tax withholdings.

Completely fake.

[Space]

The tenant had downloaded a template for $15.
Filled it out in 10 minutes.
Nearly got approved for a $2,400/month unit.

[Space]

Here's how the landlord finally caught it:
[3 bullet points]

[Space]

This is why we built Income Checker.
Bank-verified income. No PDFs. No guessing.

What's the sketchiest document you've ever received from an applicant?
```

---

### Carousel Posts (10-15% of content)

**Best for:** Listicles, step-by-step guides, data visualization, before/after

**When to use:**
- "X tips for..." content
- Process explanations
- Statistics and data
- Comparisons (old way vs. new way)

**Structure:**
- Slide 1: Bold hook + "Swipe for more"
- Slides 2-8: One point per slide, minimal text
- Final slide: CTA + summary

**Topic ideas:**
- "5 Signs a Pay Stub is Fake (Swipe)"
- "The Tenant Screening Process in 2026 vs. 2016"
- "3 Income Verification Methods Compared"
- "Red Flags in Rental Applications (Part 1)"

**Tools:** Canva (free templates), Figma, or Taplio's carousel creator

---

### Poll Posts (5% of content - 1-2x per month)

**Best for:** Engagement spikes, audience research, starting conversations

**Poll formula:**
```
[Interesting question related to pain point]

[Brief context - 1-2 lines]

[Poll options - 4 max, make them specific]
```

**High-performing poll topics:**

1. "What's your biggest screening headache?"
   - Verifying income
   - Checking references
   - Background checks
   - All of the above

2. "How do you currently verify tenant income?"
   - Pay stubs only
   - Bank statements
   - Employer verification
   - I don't verify income

3. "Have you ever had a tenant submit fake documents?"
   - Yes, caught them
   - Yes, didn't catch them until later
   - Not that I know of
   - I don't check documents closely

4. "What would you pay for instant income verification?"
   - $5-10
   - $10-20
   - $20-30
   - Wouldn't pay for it

**Follow-up:** Comment on your own poll with additional context and reply to every response.

---

### Story Posts (Personal Angle)

**Best for:** Building connection, showing personality, vulnerable moments

**When to use:**
- Founder journey milestones
- Lessons from failures
- Personal "why" behind building the company
- Celebrating team wins

**Structure:**
```
[Personal hook - something happened]

[The situation/context]

[What you learned or realized]

[How it connects to what you're building]

[Reflection or question for audience]
```

**Example:**

```
3 years ago, I helped my uncle screen a tenant.

We did everything "right."
Credit check. References. Pay stubs.

The tenant got approved.
Within 4 months, they stopped paying.
$8,000 in lost rent.
$4,000 in legal fees.
6 months to finally evict.

The pay stubs were fake.

I couldn't stop thinking: why is income verification so easy to fake?

That question led me here.

Building Income Checker.
Bank-verified income.
In minutes.

What's the moment that made you rethink how you do something?
```

## 5. Engagement Strategy

### Finding and Engaging Target Prospects

**Step 1: Build your feed with the right content**

Follow and engage with:
- Landlord/REI influencers (BiggerPockets hosts, local RE investors)
- Property management companies
- Real estate attorneys
- PropTech founders
- Apartment association leaders

**Step 2: Daily engagement routine (15-20 min/founder)**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Morning (10 min) | Comment on 5 posts from target audience |
| Afternoon (5 min) | Respond to all comments on your posts |
| Evening (5 min) | Send 3-5 connection requests |

**Step 3: Use LinkedIn Search to find prospects**

Search queries:
- "landlord" (filter by 2nd degree connections)
- "property manager" (filter by location)
- "real estate investor" (filter by "People")
- "rental property owner"

**Step 4: Engage before connecting**

- Comment on 2-3 of their posts over a week
- Like and react to their content
- Then send connection request (they'll recognize you)

---

### Comment Strategy

**Goals of commenting:**
1. Get noticed by the poster (potential prospect)
2. Get noticed by their audience (visibility)
3. Add value that positions you as an expert

**Comment formula:**
```
[Validate their point]
[Add your unique insight or experience]
[Optional: Ask a follow-up question]
```

**Good comment examples:**

On a post about tenant screening challenges:
```
This is so true. We see this constantly - landlords spending hours chasing documents that may not even be legitimate. The shift toward bank-verified data can't come fast enough. What's been your experience with Plaid-based verification?
```

On a post about bad tenant experiences:
```
Stories like this are exactly why we built Income Checker. Pay stubs are too easy to fake. Bank data doesn't lie. Sorry you went through this - hope the next one goes smoother.
```

On a post about rental market trends:
```
Great data here. The point about income verification is spot on. We're seeing landlords move away from traditional docs entirely. Curious - are you seeing this shift in your market too?
```

**Comments to avoid:**
- "Great post!" (no value)
- Long pitches about your product (salesy)
- Disagreeing aggressively (burns bridges)
- Generic statements (forgettable)

---

### DM Approach After Engagement

**Timing:** Only DM after 2-3 meaningful interactions (comments, reactions)

**DM Framework:**

```
Hey [Name],

I've been enjoying your posts about [specific topic they post about]. Your point about [specific insight] really resonated.

Quick question - as someone who [manages properties / owns rentals / works with landlords], have you run into challenges with income verification? We're building something in this space and I'd love your perspective.

No pitch - genuinely curious about your experience.

[Your name]
```

**Follow-up if they respond with interest:**

```
Thanks for sharing that.

We're building Income Checker - basically lets applicants connect their bank account (like Venmo does) and landlords get a verified income report in minutes. No pay stubs to fake.

Would love to show you a 2-minute demo if you're curious. Either way, appreciate the conversation.
```

**If no response after 5-7 days:**

Don't follow up. Continue engaging with their public content.

### Connection Request Templates

"Why do [audience] still [outdated practice] when [better alternative exists]?"

---

### CTA Variations

- "What's your experience with this?"
- "Drop a comment if you've seen this too."
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "What would you add to this list?"
- "Tag a landlord who needs to see this."

**Medium CTAs:**
- "DM me 'VERIFY' if you want to see how it works."
- "Link to our free guide in comments."
- "I wrote a longer breakdown on this - comment 'GUIDE' and I'll send it."

**Hard CTAs (use sparingly - 1-2x per week max):**

- "Book a 10-minute demo - link in my bio."
