## Escalation Path

**If Tyrese hits a wall:**
- Can't find contacts → Clarence helps with Apollo searches
- Low email open rates → Test new subject lines (see templates doc)
- No one answering calls → Adjust call times, try different scripts

**If Lamar hits a wall:**
- Getting kicked from groups → Slow down, more value first
- No engagement → Try different post types
- No leads → Focus on answering questions, not posting

Based on Week 1-2 learnings:
- Double down on what's working
- Cut what's not
