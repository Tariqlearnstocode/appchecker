# How to View Product Changes

*A quick guide for Tyrese & Lamar*

---

## The Short Version

Go here: **[github.com/Tariqlearnstocode/appchecker](https://github.com/Tariqlearnstocode/appchecker)**

That's the Income Checker codebase. You don't need an account to view it — it's public.

---

## What You're Looking At

GitHub is where all the code lives. Every time Tariq makes a change to the product, it gets logged here. Think of it like a detailed changelog for everything that happens under the hood.

## How to See Recent Changes

### Option 1: Quick View (Commits)

1. Go to the repo: [github.com/Tariqlearnstocode/appchecker](https://github.com/Tariqlearnstocode/appchecker)
2. Click on **"commits"** (near the top, shows a number like "47 commits")
3. You'll see a list of every change, newest first

Each commit shows:
- **Date** — when it happened
- **Title** — short description of what changed
- **Tariq's name** — who made the change

Click any commit to see exactly what code was added or removed (green = added, red = removed).

### Option 2: Check the Activity

On the main repo page, you'll see recent activity right away — the latest commit message shows at the top of the file list.

## What to Look For

You don't need to understand the code. Just skim the commit messages for things like:

- "Added [feature]" — new functionality
- "Fixed [bug]" — something broken got repaired
- "Updated [component]" — improvements to existing stuff
- "UI changes" — visual updates
- "API integration" — connecting to external services

---

## When to Check

- **Before sales calls** — know what's new so you can speak to recent improvements
- **When a customer asks about features** — verify what's live vs. coming soon
- **Weekly** — stay in the loop on product momentum

---

## Pro Tips

- **Star the repo** — If you create a free GitHub account, you can "star" the repo and it'll show up in your GitHub homepage for quick access
- **Watch for releases** — If Tariq starts tagging releases, you'll see version numbers (v1.0, v1.1, etc.) that bundle changes together
- **Ask in the group chat** — If you see a commit and don't know what it means, just ask

## Questions?

If something's unclear or you want a walkthrough, ping Tariq. This stuff looks technical but it's really just a logbook of product changes.
