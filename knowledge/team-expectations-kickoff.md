# Income Checker - Team Expectations & Kickoff

*The playbook for how we work together*
*Created: 2026-01-28*

---

## The Big Picture

**Where we're going:**
- 250 recurring property managers = $20k/m 
- That's the north star. Everything we do ladders up to this.

**How we get there:**
- Direct sales (primary) — outbound calls, emails, Facebook, BiggerPockets
- Brand building (secondary) — SEO, content, reputation over time
- Week by week, customer by customer

**The math:**
- $10K/month = ~170 verifications or ~17 Pro subscribers
- $40K/month = ~670 verifications or ~67 Pro subscribers
- Both are very attainable with consistent effort

---

## Goals (In Order)

### Goal 1: First Paying Customer Renews
Not just a signup — a customer who pays, uses the product, and **renews**.
This proves product-market fit.

### Goal 2: 10 Paying Customers
Repeatable sales process. We know how to find and close customers.

### Goal 3: We Fly
After 10 customers with a repeatable process, we scale what works.

---

## Time Commitment

| Team Member | Weekly Hours | Focus |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **Tariq** | 15-25 hrs | Product, tech, infrastructure |
| **Tyrese** | 15-25 hrs | List building, calls, emails |
| **Lamar** | 15-25 hrs | Facebook groups, BiggerPockets, demos |

**This is the minimum.** More hours = faster growth. But consistency beats intensity — 15 focused hours every week beats 40 hours one week and zero the next.

---

## Meeting Cadence

**3 meetings per week:**

| Meeting | When | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|------|----------|---------|
| **Monday Kickoff** | [TBD] | 60 min | Set weekly priorities, review pipeline |
| **Wednesday Check-in** | [TBD] | 30 min | Quick sync, unblock issues |
| **Friday Wrap-up** | [TBD] | 30 min | Review metrics, wins, learnings |

**Rules:**
- Camera on

- If you can't make it, say so in advance

**Suggested times (adjust based on schedules):**

## The Overlap Reality

In these early phases:
- Roles will overlap
- You'll do things outside your lane
- Unexpected fires will happen

**This is normal.** We don't have the luxury of clean boundaries yet.

### Shared Responsibilities (Everyone Pitches In)

| Area | What It Means | Who Might Do It |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Accounting** | Invoices, expenses, tracking revenue | Tariq (for now), eventually bookkeeper |
| **Design** | Social graphics, pitch decks, one-pagers | Whoever needs it, Canva is your friend |
| **Admin** | Scheduling, organizing docs, CRM cleanup | Everyone owns their own |
| **Marketing** | Writing posts, creating content | Tyrese + Lamar primarily, Tariq supports |
| **Copywriting** | Email copy, landing pages, sales materials | Collaborate, Tariq finalizes |
| **Customer Support** | Answering questions, troubleshooting | Whoever sees it first, escalate to Tariq if technical |
| **Legal/Compliance** | Contracts, terms, privacy | Tariq handles, team flags issues |

**The rule:** If you see something that needs doing and you can do it, do it. Don't wait for permission or for it to be "your job."

### Fiverr for Overflow

We don't need to do everything ourselves. **Fiverr is available** for cheap, quick labor on:

| Task | Typical Cost | When to Use |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Logo/graphic design | $20-50 | Social posts, one-pagers, pitch decks |
| Bookkeeping | $50-100/mo | Monthly reconciliation, expense tracking |
| Video editing | $30-75 | Demo videos, testimonial clips |
| Copywriting | $25-75 | Landing page copy, email sequences |
| Data entry | $15-30 | List cleanup, CRM imports |
| Presentation design | $30-75 | Investor decks, sales presentations |

**How to use it:**
1. Need something? Check if Fiverr can handle it
2. Find a seller with good reviews
3. Expense it (keep receipts)
4. Don't spend hours on something a $30 gig can solve

This won't be constant work — just occasional tasks. Cheap labor for stuff that's not worth your hourly rate.

As we grow:
- $10K/month → We can hire VAs for grunt work
- $25K/month → We can bring on specialists
- More equity available for key hires if needed

**For now:** All hands on deck. Help each other. No "that's not my job."

---

## Rule #1: If the Customer Wants It, We Can Do It

This is non-negotiable.

**When a prospect asks for:**
- A custom report format → "Yes, we can do that"
- A specific feature → "Yes, we're building that"
- A special integration → "Yes, let's talk about it"
- Bulk pricing → "Yes, let's discuss enterprise"

**Then:**
- Promise it
- Tell Tariq
- We figure out custom pricing (enterprise deal)
- Tariq builds it

**Why:** Every custom request is an enterprise sale opportunity. These deals are worth 10x a standard subscription. Never say no — say "yes, and here's what that looks like."

---

## How We Work

### Document Everything
- Sales calls → Notes in HubSpot
- Customer feedback → Share in Slack/group chat
- What's working → Write it down
- What's not → Write it down

If it's not documented, it didn't happen. This is how we learn and scale.

### Share Feedback Openly
- See something that could be better? Say it.
- Have an idea? Share it.
- Disagree with a decision? Speak up.

No egos. No defensiveness. We're building something together.

### Momentum Is Everything
- Consistency > perfection
- Activity > strategy
- Done > perfect

The companies that win are the ones that keep moving. Every day we're not talking to customers is a day wasted.

---

## Resources Available

**Don't be scared to ask.**

We have access to:
- VA networks for repetitive tasks (data entry, research, scheduling)
- Tools and subscriptions (just ask)
- Tariq's dev time for custom builds

**Examples of what VAs can handle:**
- List building / data scraping
- CRM data entry
- Scheduling and calendar management
- Basic customer support responses
- Social media posting

If you're spending hours on something a VA could do, tell Tariq. We'll get help.

## Questions to Decide Together

2. **Communication tool** — Slack? Discord? iMessage group?
3. **Response time expectation** — How fast do we reply to each other?
4. **Decision authority** — Who can say yes to what without checking?
