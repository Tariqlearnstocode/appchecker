## 1. Group Discovery

### Search Terms to Find Groups

Use these exact searches in Facebook's search bar, then filter by "Groups":

**Primary (high intent):**
- "landlord"
- "landlords"
- "rental property owner"
- "property management"
- "property manager"
- "tenant screening"
- "self managing landlord"

**Secondary (broader audience):**
- "real estate investing"
- "real estate investor"
- "rental property investing"
- "buy and hold real estate"
- "multifamily investing"
- "REI" + [city name]

**Niche (high engagement, specific pain points):**
- "Section 8 landlord"
- "Section 8 housing"
- "small landlord"
- "accidental landlord"
- "first time landlord"
- "BRRRR real estate"
- "house hacking"

**Local variations (repeat for target metros):**
- "[City] landlords"
- "[City] real estate investors"
- "[City] property management"
- "[State] rental property owners"

### Types of Groups to Prioritize

| Priority | Group Type | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| 1 - HIGH | Self-managing landlord groups | Direct users - they handle their own screening |
| 2 - HIGH | Small landlord communities (1-10 units) | Our ICP, price-sensitive, need simple solutions |
| 3 - HIGH | Local REI groups in target metros | Active engagement, real conversations |
| 4 - MEDIUM | National landlord mega-groups | High volume but noisier |
| 5 - MEDIUM | Property management professional groups | Potential larger accounts, longer sales cycle |
| 6 - LOW | General REI groups (flipping, wholesaling) | Mixed audience, some landlords but diluted |

### Group Size Sweet Spot

| Size | Assessment | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| <1,000 members | Too small, limited reach | Skip unless hyper-niche |
| 1,000-5,000 | Good for testing, manageable | Join 5-8 of these |
| 5,000-20,000 | Ideal—active but not overwhelming | Priority targets |
| 20,000-50,000 | High reach, competitive | Join top 5-6 |
| 50,000+ | Very noisy, hard to stand out | Join 2-3 biggest only |

### Red Flags: Groups to Avoid

- **Dead groups:** Last post more than 7 days ago
- **Spam-filled:** Scroll and see 5+ promotional posts in a row
- **No moderation:** No pinned rules, no admin activity visible
- **Paid promotion only:** Groups that exist only to sell courses/services
- **Generic names with no activity:** "Real Estate" with 50K members but no engagement
- **Politically charged:** Groups that mix REI with unrelated political content
- **Course-seller groups:** Groups created by gurus to sell their programs

### How to Evaluate Group Quality (5-Point Check)

Before joining, review:

1. **Posting frequency:** At least 3-5 posts per day from different members
2. **Comment engagement:** Posts getting 10+ comments, real discussions
3. **Question diversity:** Members asking genuine questions, not just promotions
4. **Admin presence:** Admins actively moderating, pinned welcome post, clear rules
5. **Member quality:** Scroll members—real profiles, not fake/spam accounts

**Quick test:** Search "income verification" or "tenant screening" within the group. If there are recent discussions, it's relevant.

## 3. Joining Strategy

### Join Velocity (Avoiding Spam Flags)

| Week | Groups to Join | Total |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Week 1 | 5 groups | 5 |
| Week 2 | 5 groups | 10 |
| Week 3 | 4 groups | 14 |
| Week 4 | 4 groups | 18 |
| Week 5+ | 2-3 groups | 20-25 |

**Why slow:** Facebook may flag accounts that join 20+ groups rapidly. Space it out over 4-5 weeks.

### Profile Optimization

Before joining groups, optimize the profile that will be requesting access:

**Profile photo:** Professional headshot, friendly, approachable

**Cover photo:** Can subtly reference real estate/property (city skyline, rental property, etc.)

**Bio/Intro:**
```
Real estate investor | Helping landlords streamline tenant screening |
Based in [City] | Ask me about income verification
```

**Work section:**
```
Founder at Income Checker
Building tools for landlords and property managers
```

**Featured section:** Pin 1-2 real estate related posts if you have them

**Public posts:** Make sure recent public posts are professional, on-topic, or neutral

### Answering Join Questions

Most active groups ask screening questions. Here are effective answers:

**"Are you a landlord/property manager? How many units?"**
```
Yes, I manage investment properties and work with landlords
on tenant screening solutions. Currently focused on helping
small landlords (1-10 units) with income verification.
```

**"What do you hope to get from this group?"**
```
I want to learn from experienced landlords and share what I've
learned about tenant screening and income verification. Always
looking to help members solve problems.
```

**"Do you agree to follow the rules and not spam?"**
```
Absolutely. I'm here to contribute value and learn, not promote.
Happy to follow all group guidelines.
```

**"How did you find us?"**
```
Searched for [landlord/property management] groups because I'm
actively working with landlords on screening challenges.
```

**Key principles:**
- Be honest about your role (founder/working with landlords)
- Lead with value contribution, not promotion
- Show genuine interest in learning
- Never lie—admins check profiles

## 4. Engagement Playbook

### The "Give Before You Ask" Timeline

| Days | Activity | Goal |
|------|----------|------|
| Days 1-7 | Silent observation | Learn group culture, identify top contributors, note common questions |
| Days 8-14 | Comment only | Leave 2-3 thoughtful comments per day on others' posts |
| Days 15-21 | Helpful comments + answers | Answer questions in your expertise area (screening, verification) |
| Days 22-30 | First value-add post | Share a tip, ask a genuine question, or post insight |
| Day 30+ | Gradual product mentions | Only when directly relevant to someone's question |

**Minimum before any product mention:** 14 days of active commenting (10-15 comments total)

### Types of Valuable Comments

**Problem-solving comments:**
```
"I had this exact issue last year. What worked for me was asking
for 3 months of bank statements instead of pay stubs—much harder
to fake and shows actual deposits."
```

**Experience-sharing comments:**
```
"Just went through this with a Section 8 tenant. The housing
authority verified their voucher amount, but I still needed to
verify the tenant's portion. Ended up using their bank statements
to confirm."
```

**Supportive/encouraging comments:**
```
"This is frustrating but you made the right call. Better to have
a vacancy than a tenant who can't pay. Keep your standards."
```

**Clarifying question comments:**
```
"Did they provide bank statements along with the pay stubs?
Sometimes that shows the full picture better than either alone."
```

**Resource-sharing comments (no self-promo):**
```
"Your state's landlord-tenant handbook covers this. Most are free
PDFs from the housing authority website."
```

### Questions to Answer (Positioning as Expert)

Look for and respond to posts containing:

- "How do I verify income..."
- "Tenant can't provide pay stubs..."
- "Self-employed applicant..."
- "How many times rent for income..."
- "1099 contractor income..."
- "Bank statements vs pay stubs..."
- "Tenant screening services..."
- "Is [X] income verification legit..."
- "Applicant claims [X] income but..."
- "How to screen without credit check..."
- "What income ratio do you require..."

### How to Naturally Mention Your Product

**Only when directly relevant. Never force it.**

**Good (responding to direct question):**
```
"We actually built a tool for exactly this—connects to their
bank account (with their permission) and shows you actual deposit
history. Way harder to fake than pay stubs. Happy to share more
if you want to DM me."
```

**Good (in context of broader answer):**
```
"I used to require 3x rent in verifiable income, but the
verification was the hard part. Pay stubs are easy to fake.
Bank statements are better but tedious to review. Eventually
I started using bank-connected verification tools—applicant
links their account and I see real transaction history.
Changed my screening process completely."
```

**Bad (forced/salesy):**
```
"You should try Income Checker! We verify income instantly!
Check out our website at [link]!"
```

### What NOT to Do (Group Etiquette Violations)

| Violation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Posting promotional content before engaging | Immediate removal, possible ban |
| Dropping links without context | Flagged as spam |
| Commenting "DM me" on every screening post | Looks desperate, reported as spam |
| Arguing with group members | Reputation damage, admin attention |
| Posting the same response to multiple threads | Spam detection, removal |
| Criticizing competitors by name | Looks petty, often against rules |
| Posting fake questions to answer yourself | Admins notice, instant ban |
| Joining and immediately posting | Shows you didn't read rules |
| Ignoring admin warnings | Ban |
| Cross-posting same content to multiple groups | Facebook flags this |

---

## 5. Content Strategy for Groups

### Types of Posts That Get Engagement

| Post Type | Engagement Level | Example |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Problem/Question posts | Very High | "What's your income verification process for self-employed applicants?" |
| Poll posts | High | "How many months of bank statements do you require?" |
| Story posts (with lesson) | High | "Just had an applicant fake pay stubs. Here's how I caught it..." |
| Tip/How-to posts | Medium-High | "3 things I check on every bank statement" |
| Discussion starters | Medium | "Anyone else seeing more applicants with gig economy income?" |
| Resource shares (free) | Medium | "Found this landlord-tenant law summary for [State]" |
| Win/Success stories | Medium | "Finally filled my vacancy with a great tenant—here's what I did differently" |

### How to Share Wins/Case Studies

**Framework:** Problem → Solution → Result → Lesson

**Example post:**
```
Had an interesting screening situation this month.

Applicant looked great on paper—good credit, stable job history,
provided pay stubs showing $5,200/month.

Something felt off. The pay stubs looked... too clean.

Asked for bank statements. They hesitated. Red flag #1.

Eventually provided them. Deposits didn't match the pay stubs at all.
Actual income was about $3,100/month. Red flag #2.

Declined the application.

Lesson: Pay stubs are easy to fake. Bank deposits don't lie.

What's your verification process look like? Anyone else require
bank statements as standard?
```

**Key elements:**
- Tell a story (people read stories)
- Include specific details
- End with a question (drives comments)
- No product mention (builds credibility first)

### Asking Questions That Start Conversations

**High-engagement question formats:**

```
"What income-to-rent ratio do you actually require?
I've seen everything from 2x to 4x."
```

```
"Controversial opinion: Credit scores matter less than income verification.
Agree or disagree?"
```

```
"Self-employed applicants: What documentation do you require?
Tax returns feel invasive but bank statements don't tell the whole story."
```

```
"How long do you give applicants to provide income documentation
before moving to the next applicant?"
```

```
"Anyone else noticing more applicants with multiple income sources?
Gig economy is making screening complicated."
```

### When to Soft-Pitch vs Hard-Pitch

**Soft-pitch (90% of the time):**
- In response to direct questions about verification challenges
- When sharing your process and tools come up naturally
- In DMs after helpful public engagement
- When someone explicitly asks for recommendations

**Hard-pitch (rare, only when appropriate):**
- Only in groups that explicitly allow promotions (check rules)
- Designated "promo days" some groups have
- When admin invites you to share
- Never in comments on others' posts

## 6. Tracking System

### Group Tracking Spreadsheet Structure

Create in Google Sheets with these columns:

| Column | Data Type | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Group Name | Text | Exact name |
| URL | Link | Direct link to group |
| Category | Dropdown | Landlord / PM / REI / Local / Niche |
| Size | Number | Member count at join |
| Join Date | Date | When you joined |
| Join Status | Dropdown | Pending / Approved / Rejected |
| Activity Level | Dropdown | Very Active / Active / Moderate / Dead |
| Promo Rules | Text | "No promo" / "Promo Fridays" / "Ask admin" |
| Comments Made | Number | Running count |
| Posts Made | Number | Running count |
| DMs Sent | Number | Running count from this group |
| Leads Generated | Number | Signups/trials from this group |
| Conversions | Number | Paying customers |
| Notes | Text | Admin names, best post times, etc. |
| Last Activity Date | Date | Last time you engaged |

### Metrics to Track

**Weekly:**
- Total comments made across all groups
- Total posts made
- DMs sent
- DMs received
- Website clicks from Facebook (UTM tagged)
- Trial signups attributed to Facebook

**Monthly:**
- Leads by group (which groups produce?)
- Conversion rate by group
- Time invested vs leads generated
- Best-performing post types
- Groups to drop (low ROI)
- New groups to add

### UTM Tracking

When sharing links (in allowed contexts), use UTM parameters:

```
https://incomechecker.com?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=groups&utm_content=[group-name]
```

This lets you track which groups drive traffic in Google Analytics.

### Recommended Weekly Time Investment

| Team Member | Time/Week | Activities |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Primary owner | 4-5 hours | Daily engagement, posting, DM follow-up |
| Secondary support | 2-3 hours | Comment backup, monitoring, tracking |
| **Total team** | **6-8 hours** | Split across week, not single sessions |

**Daily breakdown (for primary owner):**
- Morning: 20 min scanning new posts, commenting
- Lunch: 15 min responding to replies
- Evening: 15 min DM follow-ups, logging

### Ownership Recommendation

| Role | Owner | Backup |
|------|-------|--------|
| Facebook Group Strategy | Tyrese (CMO) | Lamar (CGO) |
| Daily Engagement | Tyrese | Lamar |
| Tracking/Reporting | Tyrese | Clarence |
| Content Creation | Tyrese + Clarence | — |

**Why Tyrese:** CMO role aligns with community engagement. Marketing owns the voice.

## 7. Scaling

### When to Create Your Own Group

**Prerequisites (don't create until you have):**
- 6+ months of active engagement in other groups
- Recognized as a helpful voice in 5+ groups
- Clear differentiation from existing groups
- 100+ warm contacts (newsletter, customers, connections)
- Content plan for first 30 days
- Time commitment (10+ hrs/week to grow a new group)

**Potential group concepts:**
- "Income Verification for Landlords" (niche, we're the expert)
- "Small Landlord Mastermind" (community, not product-focused)
- "[City] Self-Managing Landlords" (local, underserved)

**Not recommended:** Creating a group too early looks like a marketing ploy

### Community Building Long-Term Play

**6-Month vision:**
1. Months 1-2: Join 20+ groups, establish presence
2. Months 3-4: Become recognized in 5+ groups, generate consistent leads
3. Months 5-6: Begin building email list from group connections
4. Month 6+: Evaluate creating own group or doubling down on best performers

**12-Month vision:**
- Own Facebook group with 1,000+ members
- Weekly live Q&A in group (build authority)
- Group becomes lead generation engine
- Transition from "participant" to "host"

**Alternative to own group:** Partner with existing group admins
- Offer to do "Ask Me Anything" sessions on income verification
- Provide exclusive group discounts
- Co-create content with admins
- Become official "resource" in group

## 8. Sample Posts and Responses

### 5 Example Value-Add Posts

**Post 1: Question Post (High Engagement)**
```
Question for self-managing landlords:

When an applicant can't provide traditional pay stubs
(gig workers, 1099, small business owners), what documentation
do you require?

I've been asking for:
- 3 months bank statements
- Previous year tax return
- Letter from accountant

But it feels like overkill. What's your process?
```

**Post 2: Story Post (Experience Sharing)**
```
Screening story from this week:

Applicant applied for my 2BR. Credit was 680, seemed fine.
Pay stubs showed $4,800/month—plenty for $1,400 rent.

Here's where it got interesting.

I asked for bank statements as backup (something I started
doing last year). The deposits told a different story.
Actual monthly income: around $3,200. The pay stubs were
from a job they'd left 2 months ago.

Declined the application.

Takes an extra step, but bank deposits don't lie. Anyone
else require bank statements as standard now?
```

**Post 3: Poll Post (Discussion Starter)**
```
Quick poll for landlords:

What income-to-rent ratio do you require?

1. 2x monthly rent
2. 2.5x monthly rent
3. 3x monthly rent
4. 3.5x or higher
5. Depends on the applicant

Drop your answer and why in the comments. Curious if this
varies by market.
```

**Post 4: Tip Post (Educational)**
```
3 things I now check on every bank statement
(learned these the hard way):

1. **Consistent deposits** - Are deposits regular?
   Irregular deposits could mean inconsistent income.

2. **Deposit amounts match claimed income** - Do the numbers
   add up to what they said they make?

3. **Overdrafts/NSF fees** - Multiple overdrafts in a month
   is a red flag for cash flow issues.

Bank statements are more work than pay stubs, but they
show the real financial picture.

What do you look for?
```

**Post 5: Discussion Post (Industry Trend)**
```
Is anyone else seeing this trend?

More and more of my applicants have "non-traditional" income:
- Gig workers (Uber, DoorDash, Instacart)
- Multiple part-time jobs
- Side hustles + full-time job
- Remote freelancers

Traditional screening (employer verification, pay stubs)
doesn't work well for these folks.

How is everyone adapting their screening process?
```

### 3 Example Responses to Common Questions

**Response 1: "How do I verify self-employed income?"**
```
Self-employed tenants are tricky but not impossible.
Here's what I require:

1. **Last 2 years of tax returns** - Shows reported income
   to IRS (harder to fake)

2. **3-6 months of bank statements** - Shows actual deposits
   hitting their account

3. **Profit & loss statement** (if they have one) - Some
   freelancers track this

The bank statements are key because they show real money
coming in. Tax returns can be a year old, but bank statements
show current income.

One thing I've found helpful: look at the DEPOSITS specifically,
not just the balance. Some people have savings but no income.

What's their claimed monthly income vs rent amount?
```

**Response 2: "Applicant says they make $X but can't provide proof"**
```
If they can't provide ANY documentation, that's a red flag.

Even without traditional pay stubs, they should be able to show:
- Bank statements (everyone has a bank account)
- Cash app/Venmo history for gig workers
- Tax returns (even if last year)
- 1099s from clients
- Offer letter if they're starting a new job

"I can't provide proof" usually means one of two things:
1. They're hiding something
2. Their income is cash-based (another red flag)

I'd ask specifically for bank statements. Tell them you're
looking at deposit history, not their spending. If they refuse,
move on to the next applicant.

How much is the rent and what income did they claim?
```

**Response 3: "Is 2x rent enough income or should I require 3x?"**
```
Depends on your market and risk tolerance, but here's
my thinking:

**2x rent:** Higher risk. One unexpected expense and they
might not make rent. Only do this if:
- Strong credit history (720+)
- Stable, verifiable employment
- Savings buffer visible in bank statements

**3x rent:** Standard and safer. Gives them breathing room
for bills, emergencies, life.

**2.5x rent:** My personal sweet spot. Not as risky as 2x,
but doesn't eliminate good applicants like 3x sometimes does.

The key isn't just the ratio—it's VERIFYING the income is real.
I've seen applicants claim 4x rent but the income was fake.

What market are you in? Some areas you can't find 3x applicants.
```

### 2 Soft-Pitch Examples

**Soft-Pitch 1: In Response to Income Verification Question**
```
This is exactly the problem I kept running into.

Pay stubs are easy to fake (there are literally websites
that generate them). Calling employers gets you "we can
only confirm employment dates." Tax returns are a year old.

I got frustrated enough that I started looking for tools
that connect directly to applicants' bank accounts—they
authorize access, and you see actual deposit history.

Way harder to fake real bank data. It's changed how I
screen completely.

If you want, I can share what I use—DM me and I'll send
the details.
```

**Soft-Pitch 2: In Response to "What screening services do you use?"**
```
For credit, I use [TransUnion/RentPrep/etc.]

For income verification specifically, I switched to
bank-based verification tools this year. The applicant
connects their bank account (like how Venmo works), and
I see their actual transaction history.

Shows real deposits, income patterns, how they manage
money. Much better than reviewing pay stubs which are
easy to fabricate.

My company actually built a tool for this—focused on
income analysis specifically. $14.99 per verification,
results in minutes. Happy to share more if anyone's
interested, just DM me.

What's everyone else using for income verification?
```
