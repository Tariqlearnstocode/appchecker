## Competitive Landscape

- **AppFolio Income Verification** - Bundled with their PMS, not standalone
- **Plaid-based solutions** - Developer-focused, not landlord-friendly
- **Traditional screening** (TransUnion, Experian) - Expensive, slow, overkill
- **Pay stub verification** - Manual, easy to fake

**Our edge:** Purpose-built for landlords, affordable, instant, privacy-respecting.
